# Task List: Homeowners Insurance AI - Comprehensive Implementation

## Relevant Files

- `src/App.tsx` - Main application component that will need to be updated with new routing and layout
- `src/components/ui/` - Existing design system components that will be extended for new features
- `src/lib/utils.ts` - Utility functions that will need authentication and API helpers
- `backend/` - New backend directory structure for Express.js API
- `backend/src/index.ts` - Main Express server entry point
- `backend/src/middleware/auth.ts` - JWT authentication middleware
- `backend/src/routes/auth.ts` - Authentication API routes

- `backend/src/services/ai.ts` - OpenAI integration service
- `backend/src/services/stripe.ts` - Mock Stripe payment service
- `backend/src/models/` - Database models and Prisma schema
- `backend/src/utils/` - Backend utility functions
- `src/components/auth/` - Authentication-related React components
- `src/components/households/` - Household management components
- `src/components/rooms/` - Room and photo management components
- `src/components/inventory/` - Inventory management components
- `src/hooks/` - Custom React hooks for API calls and state management
- `src/contexts/` - React contexts for global state management
- `src/types/` - TypeScript type definitions

### Notes

- Unit tests should typically be placed alongside the code files they are testing (e.g., `MyComponent.tsx` and `MyComponent.test.tsx` in the same directory).
- Use `npx jest [optional/path/to/test/file]` to run tests. Running without a path executes all tests found by the Jest configuration.
- The existing design system components in `src/components/ui/` should be leveraged and extended for new features.
- Backend will be a new Express.js application with TypeScript, separate from the existing React frontend.
- Database will use PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM for type-safe database operations.
